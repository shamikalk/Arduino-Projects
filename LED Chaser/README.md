# 🔦 Dynamic LED Chaser Projects using Arduino UNO

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains **three Arduino LED Chaser programs** designed to demonstrate different LED animation patterns using an **Arduino UNO**.

Dynamic lighting effects are commonly used in electronics projects, but they often require complex circuitry and programming. These projects simplify the learning process by using basic Arduino logic to control multiple LEDs in sequential and patterned animations.

These projects are part of a **12-in-1 Electronics Learning Kit** and are ideal for beginners and students.

## 🔌 Circuit Description

- Each LED is connected to an Arduino digital pin via a 220Ω resistor.
- All LED cathodes are connected to the Arduino GND.
- The Arduino controls each LED individually to create chasing and animation effects.
- Power can be supplied using USB or the battery holder with switch.
