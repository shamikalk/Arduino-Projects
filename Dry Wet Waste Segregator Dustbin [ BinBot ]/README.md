# Dry Wet Waste Segregator Dustbin ♻️

The **Dry Wet Waste Segregator Dustbin** is an automated system designed to detect and separate **dry** and **wet waste** using an **ultrasonic sensor** and a **soil moisture sensor**.  
This project helps improve waste management efficiency, reduces manual effort, and promotes better hygiene.

## 📌 Project Overview

The system works by:
- Detecting the presence of waste using an **ultrasonic sensor**
- Measuring moisture content using a **soil moisture sensor**
- Classifying waste as **Wet** or **Dry**
- Rotating a **servo motor** to direct waste into the appropriate bin

This project is ideal for **smart city**, **IoT**, and **automation** based waste management applications.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The ultrasonic sensor detects an object placed in front of the system.
2. Once detected, the soil moisture sensor checks the moisture level of the waste.
3. If the moisture value exceeds a predefined threshold, the waste is classified as **Wet Waste**.
4. Otherwise, it is classified as **Dry Waste**.
5. The servo motor rotates to the corresponding position to segregate the waste.
