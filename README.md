A curated collection of Arduino projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. This repository contains various Arduino-based implementations, experiments, and circuit diagrams.

## 🚀 Introduction

This repository serves as a personal collection and learning resource for Arduino projects. Each project here is a collection of resources taken from YouTube, the internet, and my own documentation. Each project file has its own code, a circuit diagram, and a README.md file that explains the project. It provides a clear understanding of the project.

### Note ‼️
I have put comments in the code. I have put them in both English and Sinhala languages. The order is as follows

```// English Comment | Sinhala Comment 🇱🇰```

This is how it is. Pay attention to that.
