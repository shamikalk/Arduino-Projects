## 📚 Required Arduino Libraries (Very Important)

Before uploading the code, **make sure the following libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE**:

- **Servo Motor Library**
- **Joystick Library**

### 🔍 How to Check if Libraries Are Installed
1. Open **Arduino IDE**
2. Go to **File → Examples**
3. Scroll down and check if **Examples from Custom Libraries** is visible  
   - If visible ✅ libraries are installed correctly

### 📥 How to Install / Update Libraries
1. Open **Arduino IDE**
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + I** to open **Library Manager**
3. In the **Search Box**, type:
   - `Servo`
   - `Joystick`
4. If not installed → click **Install**
5. If already installed → check for **Updates** and update if available

⚠️ **If errors appear after installation**, close the Arduino IDE and reopen it, then try again.

## 🔌 Power System Wiring Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to avoid power issues:

- The **Double Battery Holder** has:
  - 🔴 Red Wire (Positive)
  - ⚫ Black Wire (Negative)

### 🔋 Connections
1. Connect the **Black (Negative) wire** directly to the **DC Jack negative terminal**
2. Connect the **Red (Positive) wire** to **one pin of the switch**
3. Connect the **other pin of the switch** to the **Positive terminal of the DC Jack**

✅ This setup allows safe power control using the switch.
